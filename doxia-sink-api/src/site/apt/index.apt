Doxia Sink API

  The <Sink> interface is a generic markup language interface provided as a Java API.
It contains several methods that encapsulate common text syntax. A start tag is denoted by
<<<xxxx()>>> method and a end of tag by <<<xxxx_()>>> method.

  For instance, you could do things like:

+--
sink.paragraph();
sink.text( "my text" );
sink.paragraph_();
+--

  similar to this HTML markup:

+--
<p>my text</p>
+--
