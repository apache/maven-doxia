# DOXIA-616: Fenced Code Block

This is Java code and must be tagged so such.

```java
// Fenced Code Block 1
System.out.println("Hello, Fenced Code Block!");
```

This is non-specified code:

```
# Fenced Code Block 2
ch = fopen("/tmp/test.log", "r");
```

This is similar to indented block:

    // Indented Code Block
    System.out.println("Hello, Indented Block");

And it is also different from the inline code: `System.out.println("Hello, Inline Code");`, which remains simple.

And what about ```System.out.println("Inline fenced code");```?
