doxia-module-markdown

  Markdown is a popular lightweight markup language, easy to read and easy to write.
  It is supported by a large panel of websites, text editors/IDEs and converter tools.
  Markdown format is supported both as source (parser) and destination (sink), the latter only since version 1.12.0.

* Metadata

  Although metadata was not part of the original Markdown format it is now widely supported through multiple extensions.
  This modules supports the following two metadata formats:

  * {{{http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/metadata.html}MultiMarkdown Metadata}}

  * {{{https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java/wiki/Extensions#yaml-front-matter}YAML front matter}}
  
  Metadata must be placed at the beginning of the document, before any other content.
  
  []

  Currently only the following metadata elements are supported:
  
  * <<<title>>> - the title of the document, used as the sink's title
  
  * <<<author>>> - the author of the document, used as the sink's author
  
  * <<<date>>> - the date of the document, used as the sink's date
  
  * everything else is just written as meta tags in the output document
  

* Extensions

  As the original Markdown specification is simple many extensions have been created to add features to the original Markdown format.
  The following extensions are supported by this module:
  
** GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) extensions:
  
  GitHub specified {{{https://github.github.com/gfm}extensions}} to the original Markdown format, which are now widely used. 
  Some of these extensions are also supported by this module.
  
  * {{{https://github.github.com/gfm/#tables-extension-}tables}}
  
  * {{{https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-}strikethrough text}}

** Others

* Parser

  The parser will first convert Markdown into HTML and then parse the HTML into Doxia Sink API methods calls.
