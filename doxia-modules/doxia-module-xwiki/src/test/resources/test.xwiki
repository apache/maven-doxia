this is how you would code a mojo!

{code}
public class MyMojo
    extends AbstractMojo
{
    /**
     * @parameter expression="${plugin.artifacts}"
     * @required
     */
    private List pluginArtifacts;

    public void execute()
        throws MojoExecutionException
    {
        ...
        for ( Iterator i = pluginArtifacts.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
        {
            Artifact pluginArtifact = (Artifact) i.next();
        }
        ...
    }
}
{code}
