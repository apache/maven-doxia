      <question>How to export in PDF?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There are two modules available that can be used to generate pdf output: an
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia/doxia-modules/doxia-module-itext/">iText module</a>
          that uses the
          <a href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/">iText</a> framework, and a
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia/doxia-modules/doxia-module-fo/">FO</a> module,
          that can be used e.g. in conjunction with
          <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a> to generate a pdf.
          Unfortunately, the iText team has discontinued the XML to PDF functionalities, so probably
          only the fo module is going to be supported in the future.

          A pdf plugin for m2 is currently in development in the Doxia sandbox. You can get the source
          <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/sandbox/trunk/plugins/maven-pdf-plugin/">here</a>.

    <faq id="Is_it_possible_to_create_a_book">
      <question>Is it possible to create a book?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Doxia also has a fairly simple tool for writing books. It comes complete with a Maven plugin
          to produce PDFs, LaTeX documents and Xdoc for direct integration in your Maven site.
          The <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/doxia/doxia/trunk/doxia-book/">Doxia Book code</a>
          is still limited but fully functional.
        </p>

          See <a href="./book/index.html">Writing Books in Doxia</a> for more information.

    <faq id="Why XML based sinks don't generate nicely formatted documents">
      <question>Why XML based sinks don't generate nicely formatted documents?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          We decided to keep pretty printing out of the core modules. So, XML based sinks like Xdoc or XHTML are
          intentionally unformatted. You could always do this after the document generation or directly
          by creating a specialized end-user sink (see <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/DOXIA-255">DOXIA-255</a>).

    <!-- TODO need to publish XSD files -->
    <faq id="doxia-xsd">
      <question>Where are the Maven Doxia XSD schemas for Xdoc and FML files?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The Xdoc XSD is located <a href="http://maven.apache.org/xsd/xdoc-2.0.xsd">here</a> and
          the FML XSD is located <a href="http://maven.apache.org/xsd/fml-1.0.1.xsd">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your favorite IDE probably supports XSD schema's for Xdoc and FML files. You need to
          specify the following:
        <source>
&lt;document xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/XDOC/2.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/XDOC/2.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/xdoc-2.0.xsd"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/document&gt;</source>
